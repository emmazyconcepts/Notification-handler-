# Automated Deposit Notification

This Node.js code handles the notification process when an automated deposit fails due to insufficient funds in a user's wallet. It interacts with microservices such as the User Management Service and User Wallet microservice to fetch user information and check wallet balance. Based on the notification type specified, it sends mobile or email notifications to the user.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version) should be installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the code as a ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Install dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Update API Endpoints:

   - Open the `notifications.js` file in a code editor.

   - Locate the API endpoint placeholders in the code:

     ```javascript
     // Replace the API endpoint placeholders with the actual URLs of your microservices
     const userManagementEndpoint = 'https://user-management-service/api/users/';
     const userWalletEndpoint = 'https://user-wallet-service/api/wallets/';
     ```

   - Replace `'https://user-management-service/api/users/'` with the actual URL of the User Management Service API endpoint.

   - Replace `'https://user-wallet-service/api/wallets/'` with the actual URL of the User Wallet microservice API endpoint.

5. Run the Code:

   - In the terminal, execute the following command to run the code:

     ```shell
     node notifications.js
     ```

   - The code will execute and handle the notification process for a failed automated deposit. You will see the output in the terminal, including success messages or error logs.

## Configuration

The code includes the following configuration options:

- `userID`: The ID or username of the user who missed the automated deposit. Replace `'user123'` in the example code with the actual user ID.

- `amount`: The amount of the deposit that was attempted. Replace `100` in the example code with the actual deposit amount.

- `notificationType`: Specify the notification type as `'mobile'` or `'email'`. Replace `'mobile'` in the example code with the desired notification type.

## Error Handling

The code includes error handling for fetching user information, checking wallet balance, and sending notifications. If an error occurs during any of these processes, an appropriate error message will be logged in the terminal.
